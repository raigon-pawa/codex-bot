# Codex

Codex is a modular Discord bot designed for university groups, gaming friends, and casual
communities who want productivity + fun in one place. Built for private friend servers but
powerful enough for public release, Codex combines study tools, AI assistance, gaming
utilities, and social features into a smooth, modern experience.

Built with **[discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/) 2.7** on **Python 3.14**.

## What's in this repo right now

A complete, runnable foundation that already exercises the main Discord interaction
surfaces, so you can confirm everything works before piling on features:

| Cog            | What it demonstrates                                                        |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `general`      | Slash commands, rich embeds (`/ping`, `/serverinfo`, `/userinfo`, `/help`)  |
| `events`       | Gateway listeners + `members` intent (welcome / goodbye messages)           |
| `moderation`   | Permission-gated commands (`/kick`, `/ban`, `/timeout`, `/clear`)           |
| `components`   | Buttons, select menus, modals, **and** user/message context menus           |
| `social`       | XP & levels with SQLite persistence (`/rank`, `/leaderboard`)               |

11 slash commands + 2 context menus, all verified to load.

## Quick start

```bash
# 1. Create & activate a virtual environment
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate          # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# 2. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 3. Configure secrets
cp .env.example .env               # then edit .env (see Part 1 below)

# 4. Run
python bot.py
```

> **Python 3.14 note:** discord.py needs the `audioop` module for voice, which was removed
> from the standard library in Python 3.13. The `audioop-lts` package restores it and is
> pulled in automatically as a dependency — no action needed.

---

## Part 1 — Discord Developer Portal setup

Everything below happens at <https://discord.com/developers/applications>.

### 1.1 Create the application

1. Click **New Application**, name it `Codex`, accept the terms, **Create**.
2. On **General Information**, set the description, app icon, and tags. Copy the
   **Application ID** → this is `APPLICATION_ID` in your `.env`.
3. (Optional) Set **Interactions Endpoint URL** only if you ever go HTTP-only. With
   discord.py you connect over the **gateway**, so leave this blank.

### 1.2 The Bot user & token

1. Open the **Bot** tab.
2. Click **Reset Token**, confirm, and copy it → this is `DISCORD_TOKEN` in `.env`.
   Treat it like a password; never commit it. (`.env` is already git-ignored.)
3. Set the bot's **username**, **avatar**, and **banner** here.
4. **Public Bot** — turn OFF while it's a private friends' bot; ON when you want anyone
   to be able to invite it.
5. **Requires OAuth2 Code Grant** — leave OFF unless you have a backend doing the auth-code
   flow.

### 1.3 Privileged Gateway Intents  ← easy to miss

Still on the **Bot** tab, scroll to **Privileged Gateway Intents** and enable all three:

- **Presence Intent** — member online status / activities.
- **Server Members Intent** — join/leave events, member lists, role automation.
- **Message Content Intent** — read message text (needed for the leveling system,
  prefix commands, and AI replies).

These mirror the three privileged intents Codex requests in `config.py`. **If they're
off here, the bot crashes on login** with `PrivilegedIntentsRequired`.

> Once your bot is in 100+ servers you must apply for verification to keep privileged
> intents. For a private friends' server you're fine.

### 1.4 Installation contexts (Guild install vs User install)

Open the **Installation** tab. Discord now supports two install targets:

- **Guild Install** — the classic "add bot to a server." Set **Scopes** to `bot` +
  `applications.commands` and pick default permissions.
- **User Install** — installs the app to a *user*, so its commands work in DMs and in
  servers where the bot isn't a member. Great for personal utility commands.

Pick the **Install Link** type (Discord Provided Link is easiest), and the generated URL
is what you share to add Codex.

### 1.5 OAuth2 — scopes & permissions (manual invite URL)

If you'd rather build the invite link by hand, open **OAuth2 → URL Generator**:

1. **Scopes:** check `bot` and `applications.commands`.
2. A **Bot Permissions** box appears. For Codex's current + planned features, select:
   `View Channels`, `Send Messages`, `Send Messages in Threads`, `Embed Links`,
   `Attach Files`, `Read Message History`, `Add Reactions`, `Use External Emojis`,
   `Manage Messages` (for `/clear`), `Manage Roles` (reaction roles / level roles),
   `Kick Members`, `Ban Members`, `Moderate Members` (timeouts),
   `Manage Events`, `Connect` + `Speak` (voice/music later).
3. Copy the generated URL at the bottom, open it, pick your server, **Authorize**.

> Prefer not to grant `Administrator` — it's a security risk and hides which permissions
> a feature actually needs.

### 1.6 Get your test server ID (for instant command updates)

In Discord: **User Settings → Advanced → Developer Mode = ON**. Then right-click your
server icon → **Copy Server ID** and put it in `.env` as `DEV_GUILD_ID`. With it set,
slash commands sync to that one server **instantly**; without it, global sync can take up
to ~1 hour to propagate the first time.

---

## Part 2 — Run it

1. Fill in `.env`:
   ```ini
   DISCORD_TOKEN=your-bot-token
   APPLICATION_ID=your-app-id
   DEV_GUILD_ID=your-test-server-id   # optional but recommended while developing
   ```
2. `python bot.py`
3. You should see `Synced N commands…` and `Online as Codex#1234`. Type `/` in your server
   and Codex's commands appear.

## Part 3 — Mapping every Discord feature to Codex

You asked to use as much of what Discord offers as possible. Here's the full surface and
where each piece lives (✅ built, 🔜 on the roadmap):

## Project structure

```
codex-bot/
├── bot.py              # entry point: CodexBot, extension loading, command sync
├── config.py           # env loading, intents, brand colour
├── requirements.txt
├── .env.example        # copy to .env
├── core/
│   └── database.py     # async SQLite helper + schema
└── cogs/               # one module per feature area
    ├── general.py
    ├── events.py
    ├── moderation.py
    ├── components.py
    └── social.py
```

**Adding a feature** = drop a new file in `cogs/`, write a `Cog` subclass with an
`async def setup(bot)` at the bottom, and add its dotted path to `INITIAL_EXTENSIONS`
in `bot.py`. That's the whole pattern.

---

## Roadmap (suggested build order)

1. **`ai`** — `/ask` and `/summarize` powered by Claude (headline feature).
2. **`study`** — pomodoro timers, `/remindme`, flashcard decks, study-session events.
3. **`roles`** — reaction/button self-assign roles + automatic level roles.
4. **`gaming`** — native polls, dice, trivia, and an LFG "looking for group" board.
5. **`music`** — voice playback (FFmpeg + yt-dlp).
6. **`automod` / `logging`** — AutoMod rules and an audit-log mod channel.
7. **`premium`** — App Subscriptions for a public-release tier.

Each is an isolated cog, so you can build and test them one at a time.
